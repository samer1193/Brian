            DUI is what is commonly called “drunk driving,” it refers to
            operating a motor vehicle while one’s blood alcohol content is above
            the legal limit set by statute, which supposedly is the level at
            which a person cannot drive safely. State statutes vary as to what
            that level is, but it ranges from .08 to .10. Driving on private
            property such as a parking lot is no defense, but sitting in a
            non-moving vehicle withoutthe ignition on probably is (sometimes
            resulting in a charge of “drunk in and about a vehicle”). This is a
            misdemeanor and is variously referred to as DUI, driving while
            intoxicated (DWI), drunk driving, or a “deuce”.

            A traffic citation is a summons issued by a law enforcement officer
            to a person violating a traffic law. A traffic citation is commonly
            known as a traffic ticket. The citation is a piece of paper that
            describes one or more violations that the person may have committed.
            On receiving a traffic citation, the accused person should appear
            before a court to pay an fine associated with the charge or contest
            the charge.

            A traffic citation may include one or more violation, depending on
            the violations made. Traffic citation may be issued for violations
            such as illegal lane change, speeding, lack of insurance, no
            fastened seat belt, or a broken tail light. You received five (5)
            Violations. To document the five (5) Violations, you will likely
            receive three (3) Traffic Citations. Two (2) Violations per Traffic
            Citation, plus one (1) Violation equals three (3) citations. If you
            received a white slip with computer printing during a Traffic Stop,
            all the Violations will likely be listed thereon.
