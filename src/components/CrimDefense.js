              A body of rules and statutes that defines conduct prohibited by
              the government because it threatens and harms public safety
              andwelfare and that establishes punishment to be imposed for the
              commission of such acts.

              The term criminal law generally refers to substantive criminal
              laws. Substantive criminal laws define crimes and may
              establishpunishments. In contrast, Criminal Procedure describes
              the process through which the criminal laws are enforced. For
              example,the law prohibiting murder is a substantive criminal law.
              The manner in which government enforces this substantive
              law—throughthe gathering of evidence and prosecution—is generally
              considered a procedural matter.

              Crimes are usually categorized as felonies or misdemeanors based
              on their nature and the maximum punishment that can beimposed. A
              felony involves serious misconduct that is punishable by death or
              by imprisonment for more than one year. Most statecriminal laws
              subdivide felonies into different classes with varying degrees of
              punishment. Crimes that do not amount to feloniesare misdemeanors
              or violations. A misdemeanor is misconduct for which the law
              prescribes punishment of no more than one yearin prison. Lesser
              offenses, such as traffic and parking infractions, are often
              called violations and are considered a part of criminallaw.

            <h4>Expungement</h4>
            <p>
              A criminal record can create difficult downstream consequences
              whether you (or your child) was arrested or convicted (or both).
              For example, employers and landlords commonly ask job applicants
              and apartment seekers whether they have ever been convicted of (or
              perhaps even arrested for) a criminal offense. Employers might not
              hire — and landlords might not rent to — people who answer “yes”
              to these questions. The good news is that, in some cases, you may
              be able to get an arrest or conviction expunged from your record.
              Read on to learn more about the expungement process.

              A traffic citation is a summons issued by a law enforcement
              officer to a person violating a traffic law. A traffic citation is
              commonly known as a traffic ticket. The citation is a piece of
              paper that describes one or more violations that the person may
              have committed. On receiving a traffic citation, the accused
              person should appear before a court to pay an fine associated with
              the charge or contest the charge.

              A traffic citation may include one or more violation, depending on
              the violations made. Traffic citation may be issued for violations
              such as illegal lane change, speeding, lack of insurance, no
              fastened seat belt, or a broken tail light. You received five (5)
              Violations. To document the five (5) Violations, you will likely
              receive three (3) Traffic Citations. Two (2) Violations per
              Traffic Citation, plus one (1) Violation equals three (3)
              citations. If you received a white slip with computer printing
              during a Traffic Stop, all the Violations will likely be listed
              thereon.
