              In 2013, the Department of Homeland Security published a federal
              regulation that allows immediate family members of U.S. citizens
              who entered the U.S. without inspection, or are otherwise
              ineligible to adjust their status in the U.S. due to overstay, to
              apply for “provisional waivers” in the United States.
              <br />
              Once their waivers are approved by the USCIS, they will be
              eligible to attend their appointments for immigrant visas in their
              countries of origin. The purpose of this program, which became
              effective on March 4, 2013, is to avoid having spouses and sons
              and daughters of US citizens be separated from their families for
              months or even years while their waivers are pending. Now, if
              these family members get their waivers, before leaving the U.S.,
              then they will be interviewed abroad. Then they reunite with their
              families in the U.S. within just a few weeks.
