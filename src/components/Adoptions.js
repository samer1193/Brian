              U.S. citizens who wish to adopt a child from a foreign country
              need to know how to find and adopt a child, how the legal process
              works in the foreign country, and how to obtain a green card and
              citizenship for the child. When trying to learn more about green
              cards through adoption, a good place to start is at the
              governmentâ€™s adoption page on the State Department website. <br />
              The State Department (DOS) has established a special website in
              which they answer frequently asked questions about the role of the
              U.S. government; provide general guidelines; explain the foreign
              adoption process; detail the naturalization and US Immigration Law
              requirements; and provide links to useful public and private
              organizations.
              <br />
