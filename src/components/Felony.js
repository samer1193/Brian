              Being convicted of an aggravated felony has serious consequences,
              under US immigration laws. It used to be the term “aggravated
              felony” referred only to murder, federal drug trafficking, and
              illicit trafficking of firearms and destructive devices. Nowadays,
              an “aggravated felony” does not have to be “aggravated” nor a
              “felony”. An “aggravated felony” includes many nonviolent offenses
              that are relatively minor.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of Aggravated Felonies</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Theft offense, including receipt of stolen property if the term
                of imprisonment is at least one year;
              </li>
              <li>
                Tax evasion in the case of where the loss to the government
                exceeds $10,000;
              </li>
              <li>
                Receipt of stolen property if the term of imprisonment is at
                least one year;
              </li>
              <li>
                Fraud or deceit offenses if the loss to the victim exceeds
                $10,000;
              </li>
              <li>Attempt to commit an aggravated felony;</li>
              <li>
                Counterfeiting – if the term of imprisonment is at least one
                year
              </li>
              <li>Offense related to alien smuggling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Although the term “aggravated felony” comes from federal law, it
              must be applied to crimes under state laws. In some cases, state
              crimes that may sound negligible to most people, do not involve
              violence and are not felonies are nonetheless viewed as aggravated
              felonies by federal immigration authorities. A conviction for an
              aggravated felony makes it difficult to receive any kind of
              immigration benefit such as a green card, naturalization, asylum,
              temporary worker status or even a visitor’s visa.

              Deportation without a Removal Hearing Before an Immigration Judge
            </p>
            <p>
              Immigrants who are convicted of an “aggravated felony” have few
              legal protections. For example, a non-LPR who is convicted of an
              aggravated felony may be administratively deported from the US
              without a hearing before an Immigration Judge.
            </p>
            <p>Mandatory Detention</p>
            <p>
              Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is required to detain
              any non-US citizen convicted of an aggravated felony upon release
              from criminal custody.
              <br />
              Ineligible for Asylum
            </p>
            <p>
              Any non-U.S. citizen convicted of an aggravated felony is
              ineligible for asylum, even if he or she fears persecution if
              returned to his or her native country.
              <br />
              Ineligible for Cancellation of Removal
            </p>
            <p>
              Any non-U.S. citizen convicted of an aggravated felony is
              ineligible for cancellation of removal which is a form of relief
              allowing Immigration Judges to allow persons to remain in the US.
            </p>
            <p>Ineligible for Certain Waivers of Inadmissibility</p>
            <p>
              Any non-US citizen who is convicted of an aggravated felony is
              inadmissible to the US. Persons in the US who have never had a
              green card may apply for a 212(h) waiver to excuse past criminal
              conduct, but only if they can show “extreme hardship” to a
              qualifying US citizen or lawful permanent resident relative.
            </p>
            <p>Ineligible for Voluntary Departure</p>
            <p>
              Non-US citizens convicted of an “aggravated felony” are ineligible
              for voluntarily departure. Instead, they will be ordered removed
              from the US.
            </p>
            <p>
              Permanent Inadmissibility Following Removal from the United States
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone removed from the US after being convicted of an aggravated
              felony is permanently inadmissible, unless he or she receives a
              special waiver from the Department of Homeland Security.
              <br />
              Enhanced Penalties for Illegally Reentering the United States
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone removed from the US following a conviction for an
              aggravated felony, and who subsequently reenters the country
              illegally, may be imprisoned for up to 20 years.

              This area of law is very complicated and it is advisable that you
              consult both an experienced immigration attorney and an
              experienced criminal defense attorney before pleading to any
              charges that may affect your immigration rights. The table below
              provides insight into what are considered aggravated felony
              convictions under federal immigration law.
