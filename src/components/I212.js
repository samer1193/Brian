              You may need a fraud waiver, if you by fraud or willful
              misrepresentation of a material fact, have sought to procure, or
              have procured a visa, other documentation, or admission into the
              US or other benefit under US immigration laws. You may have
              omitted certain information on a previous application for a visa
              or a green card. You may have failed to reveal that you were
              married. The possibilities are so many.

            <p>Fraud is lifetime bar to remaining in the US.</p>
            <p>Fraud Waivers</p>
            <p>
              The government may waive your fraud if your spouse or parent is a
              US citizen or a green card holder. However, you need to show that
              if you were not granted a fraud waiver, these relatives would
              suffer “extreme hardship.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that fraud waivers are more limited than section 212(h)
              criminal waivers. Unlike 212(h) waivers, in deciding fraud
              waivers, hardship to your children is not considered.
            </p>
            <p>Extreme Hardship</p>
            <p>
              Extreme Hardship factors include: whether your qualifying
              relatives have family ties to the US; the extent of the qualifying
              relatives’ family ties outside the US; conditions in your home
              country; financial impact of your departure from the US; and
              significant health conditions, particularly when tied to an
              unavailability of suitable medical care in your country. An 212(i)
              fraud waiver cannot be granted to a person who falsely represents,
              or has falsely represented himself to be a citizen of the US for
              any purpose or benefit under the immigration law. Applying for a
              fraud waiver is an extremely complex process.
