              Persons of extraordinary ability (EB-1) may become US legal
              permanent residents, without the labor certification process.
              Even, these people do not need an employer to submit a petition to
              the USCIS for them, because they are allowed to “self-petition”.

            <p>
              These people must demonstrate extraordinary ability in the
              sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, through
              sustained national or international acclaim. Their achievements
              must be recognized in the field through extensive documentation.
              Further, the immigration law dictates that a person of
              extraordinary ability is one who belongs to that “small
              percentage” who has “risen to the very top of the field of
              endeavor”. We can get green cards for persons of extraordinary
              ability including scientists, physicians, researchers, artists,
              reporters, athletes, entrepreneurs and performers.
