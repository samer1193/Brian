              The E-2 investor visa is authorized for a national of a country
              with which the United States has a commercial treaty, who is
              coming to the United States solely to direct and develop the
              operations of an enterprise in which he or she has invested, or is
              actively involved in the process of investing, a substantial
              amount of capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the investor is inside the U.S, we can apply for a change of
              status, extension of stay, or change of employment for you. If you
              want to speed up the processing of your petition, you may wish to
              use USCISâ€™ premium processing procedure. If the investor is
              outside of the U.S, we can apply for this category on your behalf
              directly to a U.S. consular office abroad. The investment involved
              must place lawfully acquired, owned, and controlled capital at
              commercial risk with a profit objective, and be subject to loss if
              the investment fails.
